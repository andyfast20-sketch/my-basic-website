                    <h2>🍽️ Nutrition and Feeding</h2>
                    <p>Proper nutrition is fundamental to your cat's health and wellbeing. Cats are obligate carnivores, which means they require meat in their diet to thrive.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Feeding Guidelines:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Choose quality food:</strong> Look for cat food with real meat as the first ingredient. Avoid foods with excessive fillers or by-products.</li>
                        <li><strong>Portion control:</strong> Follow the feeding guidelines on your cat food packaging, adjusting for your cat's age, weight, and activity level.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fresh water:</strong> Always provide clean, fresh water. Change it daily and consider a cat water fountain to encourage drinking.</li>
                        <li><strong>Feeding schedule:</strong> Most adult cats do well with two meals per day, while kittens need more frequent feeding (3-4 times daily).</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoid human food:</strong> Many human foods are toxic to cats, including chocolate, onions, garlic, grapes, and raisins.</li>
                        <li><strong>Treats in moderation:</strong> Treats should make up no more than 10% of your cat's daily caloric intake.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <h2>🏥 Health and Veterinary Care</h2>
                    <p>Regular veterinary care is essential for keeping your cat healthy throughout their life. Prevention is always better than cure.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Healthcare Essentials:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Annual check-ups:</strong> Even healthy cats should visit the vet at least once a year for a wellness exam.</li>
                        <li><strong>Vaccinations:</strong> Keep your cat up to date with core vaccines like rabies, feline distemper, and feline herpesvirus.</li>
                        <li><strong>Parasite prevention:</strong> Use regular flea, tick, and worm treatments as recommended by your vet.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dental care:</strong> Brush your cat's teeth regularly and schedule professional dental cleanings when needed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Spaying/neutering:</strong> Have your cat spayed or neutered to prevent unwanted litters and reduce certain health risks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Watch for warning signs:</strong> Contact your vet if you notice changes in appetite, behavior, litter box habits, or energy levels.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>🧼 Grooming and Hygiene</h2>
                    <p>While cats are naturally clean animals, they still benefit from regular grooming to maintain their coat and overall health.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Grooming Tips:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Regular brushing:</strong> Brush short-haired cats weekly and long-haired cats daily to prevent matting and reduce hairballs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Nail trimming:</strong> Trim your cat's nails every 2-3 weeks to prevent them from becoming overgrown or causing injury.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ear cleaning:</strong> Check ears weekly for dirt, wax, or signs of infection. Clean gently with a vet-approved solution if needed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Eye care:</strong> Wipe away any discharge from the corners of the eyes with a damp cotton ball.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bathing:</strong> Most cats don't need regular baths, but if necessary, use a cat-specific shampoo and lukewarm water.</li>
                        <li><strong>Litter box maintenance:</strong> Scoop the litter box daily and completely change the litter weekly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="care-section">
                    <h2>🎾 Exercise and Enrichment</h2>
                    <p>Mental and physical stimulation are crucial for your cat's happiness and can prevent behavioral problems and obesity.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Activity Ideas:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Interactive play:</strong> Spend at least 15-20 minutes daily playing with your cat using wand toys, laser pointers, or balls.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scratching posts:</strong> Provide multiple scratching posts or pads in different areas to satisfy natural scratching instincts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Climbing opportunities:</strong> Cats love vertical space. Install cat trees, shelves, or window perches for climbing and observing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Puzzle feeders:</strong> Use food puzzles or interactive feeders to engage your cat's hunting instincts during mealtime.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rotate toys:</strong> Keep toys interesting by rotating them weekly rather than leaving all toys out at once.</li>
                        <li><strong>Window watching:</strong> Set up a comfortable spot by a window where your cat can watch birds and outdoor activity.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>🛏️ Creating a Safe Home Environment</h2>
                    <p>Your home should be a safe haven for your cat, free from hazards and equipped with everything they need.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Safety Checklist:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Toxic plants:</strong> Remove or secure plants that are toxic to cats, such as lilies, azaleas, and sago palms.</li>
                        <li><strong>Secure windows:</strong> Ensure windows have secure screens to prevent falls, especially in high-rise buildings.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hide cords:</strong> Conceal electrical cords or use cord protectors to prevent chewing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Safe spaces:</strong> Provide quiet hiding spots where your cat can retreat when feeling stressed or overwhelmed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Temperature control:</strong> Ensure your cat has access to warm spots in winter and cool areas in summer.</li>
                        <li><strong>Secure chemicals:</strong> Keep cleaning products, medications, and other chemicals safely locked away.</li>
                        <li><strong>Microchipping:</strong> Have your cat microchipped and ensure they wear a collar with ID tags.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>❤️ Understanding Cat Behavior</h2>
                    <p>Understanding your cat's behavior helps you meet their needs and strengthens your bond.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Common Behaviors Explained:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Purring:</strong> Usually indicates contentment, but cats may also purr when stressed or in pain as a self-soothing mechanism.</li>
                        <li><strong>Kneading:</strong> This behavior (making biscuits) is a sign of contentment, stemming from kittenhood nursing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Head bunting:</strong> When cats rub their head against you, they're marking you with their scent and showing affection.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tail position:</strong> A raised tail indicates happiness, while a puffed tail signals fear or aggression.</li>
                        <li><strong>Slow blinks:</strong> When a cat slowly blinks at you, it's a sign of trust and affection—try blinking back!</li>
                        <li><strong>Chattering:</strong> The clicking sound cats make when watching birds is a hunting instinct response.</li>
                    </ul>
